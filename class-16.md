### Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.

Flexbox can style content. It has to be one-dimensional because all of the content is relative to the X and Y axis.

### Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.

The main axis is set by the `flex-direction` property. It is determined by columns or rows. Different elements have different default directions. The cross axis is the other direction. For example:

1. A Row - A row’s main axis is horizontal and the vertical axis is its cross axis.
2. The opposite applies for columns.

### How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?

Reordering is only applied to the visual aspects of the document, and not logical. Using `row-reverse`, for example, will still be read by a screen-reader in its logical HTML format.

### What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?

Float was originally intent for ‘floating’ images within blocks of text. It has been commonly used by developers for creating columns on the page. Flexbox actually allows the dev to organise materials on the page without the material needing to be relative to the objects around it.
