### Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.

A syntax error is usually a mistype or spelling error in the syntax, or characters of the document.

A logic error is more of a math error within the JavaScript logic.

### List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

Recently, when making my [Rock Paper Scissors game](https://cordeliasnape.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/) , I had a strange issue where, when updating the ‘Computer Games Won’ where it would update the count by 2 as opposed to 1. I played the game through a few times and determined to read through the function. I discovered I’d accidentally called the function twice in the event listener. It was kind of a syntax error and a logical error at the same time.

### How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

In the process of making websites, I will continue to debug problems I come across.

### How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

A debugger pauses the control flow and allows the developer to see what has happened so far.

### Define what a breakpoint is.

In the script, the breakpoint triggers automatically to pause the JavaScript execution.

### What is the call stack?

A call stack shows the nested chain calls. To explain this simply, it’s like adding a plate to a stack of other plates. When you ask the computer to do something, it adds another plate to the stack. When the function has completed its task, it is like it’s taking a plate off the stack, and then the computer moves onto the previous function in the stack.
