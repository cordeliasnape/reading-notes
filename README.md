Today, we discussed 'Growth Mindset'. 

To me, Growth Mindset is about not feeling deflated at each learning stage, but trying to approach the topic with a learning mindset. 

## Some 'Growth Mindset' reminders for myself: 
- Don't be disheartened by others' success.
  - Alternatively, don't boast about my own success to others when they are struggling.
- Try to rethink 'criticism' to being *'helpful advice'*.
- Mistakes are **necessary** to learn.
