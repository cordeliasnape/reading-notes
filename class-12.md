### To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?

We wrap text or other content in an a tag, and then use a href attribute to create a basic link.

### The href attribute contains what information?

An href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to.

### What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?

Bad link text is non-specific, which makes it difficult to know exactly what users are clicking on unless they read everything in detail. Better link text is more descriptive.

### What is meant by “normal flow”?

Normal flow is the way in which a page will be laid out without CSS being applied to it. It is designed to make a document readable.

### What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?

The two most common types of display setting are block and inline. Block elements stack vertically, and inline stacks horizontally. They can be useful for different elements and can be modified using CSS.

### \_\_\_\_ positioning is the default for every html element.

Static position is the default.

### Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.

From my experience, absolute has been useful to position elements exactly where I want them to be positioned. Especially since beginning using flex box, some objects refuse to move where I want them, so I have used position absolute in a pinch. Absolute positioning allows the element to be removed from the normal flow, and sits separately from everything else.

### What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?

Absolute positioning is relative to the nearest positioned ancestor or the document itself, whereas fix positioning is relative to the viewport, and stays on the page in the same position when you scroll.

### Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.

To declare a function is to make the function, like writing the recipe for a meal. Invoking a function is like cooking the dish, as in you place the function somewhere you need it and set the argument.

### What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Parameters are set while declaring a function, whereas arguments are set outside of that.
