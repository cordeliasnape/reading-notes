## JavaScript Loops

### 1. What is an expression in JavaScript?

According to [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators), an expression is defined as: “a valid unit of code that resolves to a value”. The `=` often assigns the value. 

### 2. Why would we use a loop in our code?

A `loop` repeats a function a number of times. Loop mechanisms allow the developer to determine when a loop starts and ends.

### 3. When does a `for` loop stop executing?

A `for` loop repeats until a condition evaluates to `false`.

### 4. How many times will a while loop execute?

According to the same [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators) article, “if the condition  becomes false, [the] statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following the loop”.
