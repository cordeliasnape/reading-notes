### What does .map() return?

`.map()` returns a new array that can be used and displayed.

### If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?

`const numbersArr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

`export default function NumberList(props) {`
` const listItems = numbersArr.map((number) => (`
`    <li>{number}</li>`
`  );`
`      `
`  return (`
`   <ul>{listItems}</ul>`
`  );`
`}`

In this example, I am using an array and `.map` to create a list.

### Each list item needs a unique \_\_\_\_.

### What is the purpose of a key?

Each list item needs a unique key. The purpose of a key to help React identify which items have changed, been added or have been removed.

### What is the spread operator?

A spread operator is used to unpack elements from an array or properties from an object and allows them to be used in another array or object.

### List 4 things that the spread operator can do.

1. Copy arrays
2. Combine/merge arrays
3. Spread arrays
4. Copy objects

### Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.

`const array1 = [1, 2, 3];`
`const array2 = [4, 5, 6];`
`const combinedArray = [...array1, ...array2];`

### Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.

`const numbersArray = [1, 2, 3];`
`const newItem = 4;`
`const newArray = […numbersArray, newItem];`

### Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.

`const userInfo = {name: ‘Cordelia’, age: 25 };`
`const userPet = {pet: ‘dog’, petName: ‘Tess’};`
`const userCombinedInfo = {…userInfo, …userPet};`

### In the video, what is the first step that the developer does to pass functions between components?

In the video, the developer’s first step is to use `.map()` to be able to access the array in the parent.

### In your own words, what does the increment function do?

Like vanilla JavaScript’s `count++`, React’s `function increment()` increases the numeric value of something. An example I recently used is allowing a count to go up when a person clicks the image.

### How can you pass a method from a parent component into a child component?

### How does the child component invoke a method that was passed to it from a parent component?

In the parent, you need to define the method you wish to pass to the child. In the child, you need to receive the method through props. The child can call the method through referencing the props and adding something that is triggered when the props are called.
