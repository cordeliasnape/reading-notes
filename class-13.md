### What is a real world use case for the alt attribute being used in a website?

Alt attributes can be used to help search engines read important context for an image.

### How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?

You can add an alt tag and captions to images to improve accessibility.

### Provide an example of when the figure element would be useful in an HTML document.

Figures are elements that you can use to give more context for the image. An example is:

> <figure>
>   <img src="image.jpg" alt="A beautiful sunset">
>  <figcaption>This is a beautiful sunset over the ocean.</figcaption>
> </figure>

### Describe the difference between a gif image and an svg image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.

An SVG is a low-quality picture that can be used for logos, illustrations and charts. It’s too low quality for large pictures. A gif is a picture that moves. You may remember using them, as it is only elders that use gifs. They can show short, looping videos of people celebrating or making a funny face.

### What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?

PNG files are best used for graphics, screenshots and charts. PNG is widely supported and can be displayed in all email clients and browsers.

### Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge.

Background is the colour behind the text, while the foreground usually refers to the text. For example, when referring to a regular reading book, this is the CSS that would be used:

> book {
> background-color: white;
> color: black;
> }

### Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?

Personally, I have been enjoying using a colour palette generator, so I would suggest some options, and allow him to choose. I could use the colours in varying degrees across the website, usually the palest colour will be the background of the main, for example, whereas the boldest colours can be used to accent text or titles. I could use colours to add borders to images, and use text-shadow to create definition around the harder-to-read text.

### What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?

Readability is the main focus for longer paragraphs, whereas fun but less-readable text could be used for headers.

### What do font-size, font-weight, and font-style do to HTML text elements?

- Font size: this determines the pixel-size of the text. For example, 12px is readable on a page-documents, but too small for a website. I use 40px for larger titles but this can vary.
- Font-weight: this determines the bold-ness vs the light-ness of the text.
- Font-style: this can turn italic text on or off.

### Describe two ways you could add spacing around the characters displayed in an h1 element.

- Line-spacing is used to add space between lines of text.
- Letter-spacing is used to make the spaces between letters larger and therefore more or less readable.
