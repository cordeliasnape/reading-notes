### What is the single responsibility principle and how does it apply to components?

The single-responsibility principle is a principle used in object-oriented programming. This principle promotes maintainability and reusability. . In react, each component should have a single, well-defined component.

### What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application?

A static app is an app without any interactivity.

### Once you have a static application, what do you need to add?

Consider where you’ll use “state” - things that will change and the functions that change them.

### What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state?

You can determine what ISN’T a state by checking:

1. If it doesn’t change.
2. If it’s passed from a parent via props.
3. If it can be computed.

### How can you identify where state needs to live?

Often, state is put directly into the common parent of what needs it. If it’s unclear where the state should, consider the scope (is the state shared amongst multiple components or is it local?), the data flow (ensure it’s flowing from parent to child) and the complexity (local state for simple component-specific data and global for complex, shared data).

### What is a “higher-order function”?

A higher order function is a function that operates on other functions by taking them either as arguments, or by returning them.

### Explore the greaterThan function as defined in the reading. In your own words, what is line 2 of this function doing?

The greaterThan(n) function is taking in n, and then returning m. It’s then saying that if m is greater than n, then it will return true.

### Explain how either map or reduce operates, with regards to higher-order functions.

When I have used map previously, I have used an arrow function to map, then parse the data shown in another document. It simplifies the process of transforming an array by applying a function to each of the elements, producing a new array with the values that were changed through the map function.
