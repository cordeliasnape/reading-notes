## Compose a short poem describing how HTTP sends data between computers.

Hypertext Transfer Protocol or HTTP is a language that allows clients and servers to speak to eachother. The ‘client’ is, according to [TechTarget](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterprisedesktop/definition/client), “any computer hardware or software device that requests access to a service provided by a server”. The ‘server’ is a program that allows for network communication. The client requests things from the server, and the server sends responses. The browser goes to the DNS sever and finds the ‘real’ website address via its server. The browser requests the HTTP and a copy of the website. This is done using the user’s internet connection. When the sever approves the client’s request, it sends the website files, and then it’s assembled and displayed by the browser.

> it requests the site
> it’s responding, assembling,
> ’it’ is the client

> it sends the data
> giving functionality:
> the server must serve

## Describe how HTML, CSS, and JS files are “parsed” in the browser.

To ‘parse’ in computing terms is to split data into smaller data that can be easily stored and manipulated. In the process of requesting and receiving the data, the browser first recognises the links between the HTML and the CSS stylesheets and JavaScript. Then, the browser requests the linked documents and generates an in-memory DOM tree through the parsed HTML. It then generates and in-memory CSSOM structure with the parsed CSS and JavaScript. The browser build the DOM tree, applies the CSS style, and executes the JavaScript.

### How can you find images to add to a Website?

You can find images for your website through the internet, but be sure to double-check the copyright, ensuring your website only uses images that adhere to the Creative Commons licenses.

## How do you create a String vs a Number in JavaScript?

In JavaScript, a string uses single or double quotation marks, eg:

> `let exampleString = ’single quotation marks’
`let exampleString = “double quotation marks”

A number doesn’t have question marks so can be recognised by using number characters:

> `let exampleNumber = 5`

### What is a Variable and why are they important in JavaScript?

## Describe the Anatomy of an HTML element.

HTML is split into two distinct parts: the head and the body.

The head contains information such as the meta content, title, links and scripts that link between other documents.

The body is the only content the user sees in the HTML document. The body contains what the user can interact with, for example, the header, the footer, navigation, text, headings, buttons and paragraphs.

## What is the Difference between <article> and <section> element tags?

Section tags are semantic HTML, and are often used when there is a thematic similarity in part of the content. An article specifies content that is best targeted independently.

## What Elements does a “typical” website include?

Typically, a website contains the following:

<ul>Header</ul>
<ul>Navigation bar</ul>
<ul>Main content</ul>
<ul>Sidebar</ul>
<ul>Footer</ul>

### How does metadata influence Search Engine Optimisation?

Metadata is what’s written in the search engine’s language and can help them to understand the page’s content better.

## How is the <meta> HTML tag used when specifying metadata?

Metadata helps communicate the content of a website. It includes titles, descriptions, keywords and other things that improve SEO efforts. Some examples are:

It can help set the language:

> `<meta charset="utf-8" />`

It can set the author of the page:

> `<meta name="author" content=“Cordelia “Snape />`

### Dynamic Websites:

<ul>Can show and hide menus using buttons.</ul>
<ul>Can change the interactivity when the user hovers over something.</ul>
<ul>Can display animations.</ul>
<ul>Interact with images.</ul>
<ul>etc…</ul>

### Creating a web or mobile app:

<ul>Provides framework for creating an app.</ul>
<ul>Provides developers with pre-written code to use for programming features.</ul>

### How can you add JavaScript to an HTML document?

You can add JavaScript to an HTML document by using this link tag in the head:

`<script src=“./app.js> </script>`
