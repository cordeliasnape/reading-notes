### Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?

Render happens first.

### What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?

First, the mounting phase occurs. Next, there is an updating phase and finally, an unmounting phase.

### Put the following things in the order that they happen: componentDidMount, render, constructor, componentWillUnmount, React Updates

1. Constructor
2. Render
3. componentDidMount
4. React Updates
5. componentWillUnmount

### What does componentDidMount do?

This allows the dev to clean up the DOM and network requests / subscriptions.

### What types of things can you pass in the props?

Props are arguments to a function. It’s what you want to initialise your render to.

### What is the big difference between props and state?

State is handled inside a component, whereas props are what is passed into a component. Props are handled outside of the component.

### When do we re-render our application?

When you change the state inside the component, the application is re-rendered.

### What are some examples of things that we could store in state?

State can change the application based on what the user has inputted. Any information you want to store within that component is stored in a state.
