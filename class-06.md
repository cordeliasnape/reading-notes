## JavaScript: The Basics

### Firstly, what is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows the developer to create more complex effects. It allows the user to be more interactive with the webpage.

### What are variables in JavaScript?

Variables are 'containers' that store data This data can be changed later on. They can be 'declared' in 4 ways. They are:

- Automatically
- Using `var`
- Using `let`
- Using `const`

### What does it mean to declare a variable?

To `declare` a variable is to assign the variable a particular data.

For example, preceding data with `const` signifies that that particular data (that can be the value or the type) is `constant` and, therefore, cannot be changed.

You can use `let` when you cannot use `const`, and if the data can be changed.

_Only_ use `var` if you **must** support old browsers.

### What is an “assignment” operator, and what does it do?

An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on its right operand's value.

These are usually math functions such as addition, subtraction and results.

### What is information received from the user called?

This is called 'input'. JavaScript displays 'output' to the user.
