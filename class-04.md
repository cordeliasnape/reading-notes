## HTML: The basics

### First, what is HTML and why do we use it?

HyperText Markup Language is the code we use to structure a website.

### What are the 3 main parts of an HTML element?

The three main parts are as follows: the start tag `<p>`, the content, and the end tag `</p>`.

### What is it called when you give an element extra information?

This is called applying an attribute, for example:

The element: `<a href="dog.html">Cute Dog</a>`

The attribute: `<href="dog.html"`

The attribute name is: `href`

The attribute value is: `"dog.html"`

### Finally, what is a semantic element?

A semantic element is best described as something that clearly describes its own meaning to both the browser and the developer. It is not a placeholder like `<div>` or `<span>`.

Some examples include:

> <header>
>
> <nav>
>
> <section>
>
> <footer>
>
> etc....
