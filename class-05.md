## CSS: Reading Summary

### Firstly, what is the purpose of CSS?

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language that is used to change how a document is presented to the user. It can be used to change a document simply, but also can be used for more complex changes such as [animations](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/css-animation-examples).

### What are the ways to insert CSS into your project?

1. External CSS
    - This must include a link to the external style sheet using `<link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css">`
2. Internal CSS
    - This can be used within the HTML itself.
3. Inline CSS

Here are some CSS examples:

> **HTML**
>
> `<body>`
>   `<p>`
>       `Hello!`
>   `</p>`
> `</body>`

> **CSS**
>
> `body {`
>    `color: red;`
>`}`

This will change all of the `body` text to red!

>`body {`
>   `background-color: black;`
>   `color: red;`
>`}`

This will keep the text red, but will change the background to black.

You can find a variety of pre-set colours available in CSS on [this](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.php) website.
