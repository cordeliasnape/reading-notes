# Task One - Learning Markdown: The Basics

Markdown is an LML (Lightweight Markup Language), which means it has simple, unobtrusive syntax. It was created in 2004 by John Gruber. When using Markdown, you have to add 'Markdown syntax', or simply put, symbols, that can change the text. It is designed to be easily read and unobtrusive, and therefore, you don't have to render it to read it.

We use Markdown because it can be used for everything. It can be used to format text on many websites such as Reddit, GitHub, and Discord. Files containing Markdown can also be opened using almost all applications, and it is considered to be 'future-proof'. This means you'll always be able to read Markdown-formatted text, even if the application you're using stops working in the future.

## So, let's cover some basic syntax you can use to make Markdown more interesting.

Generally, we must use "best practice". 'Best practice' keeps your coding legible for those who wish to read it. 

### Headings

Headings are created using the '#' symbol. The number of #'s you use corresponds to the heading you're creating:

For example: 

> "# This is my first heading." creates:
> # This is my first heading.
> 
> "## This is my second heading." creates:
> ## This is my second heading.
> 
> "### This is my third heading." creates:
> ### This is my third heading.

The smallest heading you can create is:

> "###### This is the smallest heading." creates:
> ###### This is the smallest heading.

### Text Formatting

To embolden your text, you can simply use '**' on either side of the text you wish to embolden. For example: 

> "** + Hello World. + **" creates:
> **Hello World.**

To italicize your text, you can use '*'. For example:

> "* + Hello World. + *" creates:
> *Hello World.*

### Links

To create a link using Markdown, you can use a series of brackets. For example, I wish to change 'this' to a link to Wikipedia. I need to wrap 'this' in "[ and ]", and then wrap the link to Wikipedia using ( and ).

For example:

> I wish to change ['this'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) to a link to Wikipedia.

### Unordered Lists

You can use a '*', '+' or a '-' at the beginning of a line to create an unordered list. Here are some examples:

These three all create a bullet-pointed, unordered list. For example: 

> + One
> + Two
> + Three
