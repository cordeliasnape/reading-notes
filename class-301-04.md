### What is a ‘Controlled Component’?

The controlled component is the place where the React controls the data that is being inputted into it.

### Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.

It is best to assess the reason you might need either of the choices presented.

Storing responses in real time is useful for immediate validation. An example that could be useful for a user is that it allows for the user to be notified if an email address or password has all of the required symbols such as ‘@‘. It can be useful to encourage users to choose a stronger password.

Meanwhile, waiting for form submission can be useful for users submitting a multi-stage job application. It can be useful for managing network requests and allowing for a more consistent user experience.

### How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?

To target what the user is entering into a field, you can use `event.target.value`. This gives you the text the user has typed or is typing.

### Why would we use a ternary operator?

A ternary operator is an operator that is conditional. In the same way where you’d want to use an if statement to check if something is following a condition, you can use a ternary operator.

### Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:

> if(x===y){
> console.log(true);
> } else {
> console.log(false);
> }

`x == y ? Console.log(true) : console.log(false)`
