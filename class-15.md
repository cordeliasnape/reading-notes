### Explain why we need domain modeling.

We need domain modelling because it’s the process of creating a solution for a specific problem. There are different types: conceptual domain modeling, class diagrams, state diagrams, use case diagrams, entity-relationship diagrams, data flow diagrams, sequence diagrams, activity diagrams, domain-specific languages, mathematical models, and textual descriptions to represent and describe a problem domain in software development.

### Why should tables not be used for page layouts?

A table is an easy way to visually represent information and data. Some people use tables as page layouts, having a row for the header, a row for the footer, etc. This can be difficult for people that require better accessibility, it can be harder to debug and can sometimes lead to dev problems with responsiveness.

### List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML <table>.

1. <th> - Table Header: Table headers are used to make the headings of the table stand out.
2. <td> - Table Data: This is used for data in the table.
3. <tr> - Table Row: This is used to indicate that the data within it is a row of data.

### What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?

A constructor function is used for when an object is too basic for your needs. A constructor function is used to create an object using the data layer out in the function.

### Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.

In object-oriented programming, prototypes and inhertiance are essential. Using my previous teaching experience as an example:

The teacher is the prototype, imparting their knowledge and rules on the class.
The students are individual objects. They’re unique, but also inherit some of the teacher’s characteristics.
If a teacher is particularly good at teaching a subject, then the students will inherit that subject knowledge too.
