# Class Two: Terminal

When looking for a text editor, here are four things I would be looking for:

1. Ability to implement extensions
2. Syntax auto-completion
3. Collaboration tools
4. Themes to make viewing easier

The following commands create these outcomes:

> `pwd` = Print Working Directory = Tells you what your working or present directory is
> 
> `ls` = List = Lists files
> 
> `cd` = Change Directory = Allows you to move between directories
> 
> `mkdir` = Make Directory = Allows you to make a directory with the name following the command
> 
> `touch` = Make New File = Allows you to create and modify files
