# Class Two: Terminal

When looking for a text editor, here are four things I would be looking for:

1. Ability to implement extensions
2. Syntax auto-completion
3. Collaboration tools
4. Themes to make viewing easier

### The following commands create these outcomes:

> `pwd` = Print Working Directory = Tells you what your working or present directory is
> 
> `ls` = List = Lists files
> 
> `cd` = Change Directory = Allows you to move between directories
> 
> `mkdir` = Make Directory = Allows you to make a directory with the name following the command
> 
> `touch` = Make New File = Allows you to create and modify files

### The following commands cause the following things to happen:

`cd projects` - this would put the user into the 'projects' folder
`mkdir new-project` - this would make a new directory called 'new-project'
`touch new-project/newfile.md` - this would make a new file titled 'newfile.md' in the 'new-project' folder
`cd ..` - this would take you up a level in the directory
`ls projects/new-project` - this would list the files in the 'new-project' folder
